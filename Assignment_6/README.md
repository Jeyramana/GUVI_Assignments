Brain vs Body Weight

In the file `brain_body.txt`, the average brain and body weight for a number of mammal species are recorded. Load this data into a Pandas data frame.

Tasks:
1. Find the linear regression equation for this data for brain weight to body weight.
2. Chart the original data and the equation on the chart.
3. Find the equation's $R^2$ score (use the `.score` method) to determine whether the equation is a good fit for this data. (0.8 and greater is considered a strong correlation.)
